# Why Vue?

Other alternatives that has been considered:

  - Why? Clean component model, lots of community generated components.
  - Why not? Steeper learning curve (JSX and ancillary tools & libraries).
- Angular
  - Why? Large ecosystem - integration with many UI libraries, tool for mobile app, etc.
  - Why not? Steepest learning curve.
- Elm
